# Design brief — adamu.tech

Purpose
- Serve as the single source of truth for the redesign of adamu.tech.

Goals
- Modern, credible portfolio for a computational linguist and AI researcher.
- Fast, accessible, and responsive for global audiences (WCAG AA baseline).
- Clear hierarchy: hero → work → expertise → contact.
- Retain existing content and projects; improve presentation and clarity.

Deliverables (phase 1)
- Design tokens (colors, type scale, spacing) — `tokens.css`
- High-fidelity homepage HTML/CSS (responsive) — branch `redesign/high-quality`
- Accessibility checklist and automated audit scripts
- Production-ready assets and deployment instructions

How we’ll work
- I will commit incremental changes to `redesign/high-quality`.
- You review and confirm each major change before merge to `main`.

If you have brand assets (logo SVG, preferred palette, profile photo), drop them in `design/assets/` and I’ll integrate them.
