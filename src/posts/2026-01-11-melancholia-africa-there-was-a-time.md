I sat in front of my computer,
books scattered all over the desk,
the monitor looking at me
as though it knew my name.

Piles of paper here,
the microwave speaking in beeps,
and I knew it was about time
I took the paper-made coffee cup
I kept inside the apparel.

Bless the heart of the stranger
who gave it to me for free,
when I arrived here
with the dreams of my forefathers
buried deep in my mind.

Scrolling through Facebook,
I salivated
as a random video
rose from nowhere.

Algorithm—
playing with me, not me,
I said to myself.

I was far away from home,
yet the sight of food
pulled me closer.

I smiled,
and somewhere within me
I prayed
to see my family again.

Zobo.
Koko.
Kunu.

But it was Masa I craved most,
groundnut soup with assorted meat—
goat meat, for that matter.

If I end up becoming a poet someday,
it will not be by design.

At the periphery of human experience,
there is an urge—
deep-seated,
unquiet—
for poetry.

If only the world would listen,
if only it would still
the voices of guns,
so easily named
weapons of mass destruction.
