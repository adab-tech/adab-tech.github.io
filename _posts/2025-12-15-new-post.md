# To My Mother with Love

You deserve all accolades, respects, and awards
From your children across all maternity wards.
Perplexed, unhappy, and hopeless we were
Before you made us happy, gave us hope and care.

From all mothers you are an exception.
Surely, it is impossible to find your addition.
Verily, between you and your name there is a correlation.
You taught us the rules of grammar and calculation.

In every work of Arts your name will appear,
For you are the Aesthetic itself; you have no peer.
I will apprehend anything that made you scared.
I'm a trained warrior; I am usually feared.

I am yet to have my Driver's Licence,
But I do have my Poetic Licence.
I use words, phrases and sentences
To educate, motivate and inspire the masses.

Planet Mars,
Ten billion dollars,
Ten luxurious cars,
Ten impeccable stars
Are not sufficient to reward your patience.
Every day you are in my conscience.

Only God suffices to pay you.
May He bless and cherish you!
