## Overview

The Hausa AI Chatbot is a groundbreaking conversational AI system that brings state-of-the-art language technology to the Hausa-speaking community. It combines GPT-based natural language understanding with dual speech synthesis providers (Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure) to create a seamless, culturally-aware chat experience supporting both text and voice interaction with native Hausa accents and proper tonal pronunciation.

## Problem Statement

While Hausa is spoken by over 70 million people across West Africa, AI-powered conversational tools for the language are virtually non-existent. Existing chatbots and voice assistants don't support Hausa, creating a technological divide. Speakers need modern AI tools that understand their language and culture, enabling voice and text-based interaction in their native tongue.

## Key Features

### Conversational AI
- **GPT-Powered Understanding**: Fine-tuned language model for natural Hausa conversation
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history for coherent multi-turn dialogues
- **Bilingual Support**: Handles both Hausa and English inputs seamlessly
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Trained to understand Hausa cultural context and traditions

### Voice Capabilities
- **Dual TTS Providers**: Both Google Cloud and Azure Speech Services for native Hausa accents
- **Native Voice Synthesis**: Microsoft Azure's neural voices fine-tuned for Hausa intonation
- **Speech-to-Text**: Dual STT support for improved accuracy
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency audio processing for smooth conversation
- **Voice Selection**: Multiple Hausa voices (male/female) with adjustable speaking rates

### Advanced Dataset Support
- **Mozilla Common Voice**: Integration with Hausa speech corpus
- **JW300 Parallel Corpus**: Large-scale Hausa-English parallel text
- **OPUS Dataset**: Multi-domain corpus for diverse conversation patterns
- **HausaNLP Corpus**: Specialized Hausa linguistic resources

## Technical Architecture

The system is built with:
- **Backend**: Python Flask REST API with OpenAI GPT integration
- **Frontend**: Modern HTML5/JavaScript with Tailwind CSS
- **Speech Services**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text/Text-to-Speech + Azure Speech Services
- **ML Pipeline**: Custom fine-tuning pipeline with multi-dataset support
- **Evaluation**: Phoneme-level accuracy validation and tonal metrics

## Impact

Successfully developed a production-ready conversational AI system with enhanced voice capabilities. Integrated dual speech synthesis providers for native Hausa accents, implemented comprehensive evaluation metrics for phoneme alignment and tonal accuracy, and created a scalable backend with linguistic validation framework.
