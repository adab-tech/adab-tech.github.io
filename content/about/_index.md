## Who I Am

I'm a computational linguist and AI specialist focused on building technology for African languages. My work sits at the intersection of natural language processing, machine learning, and cultural preservation.

## What I Do

I develop NLP tools, machine translation systems, and language learning applications specifically designed for low-resource African languages like Hausa, Yoruba, and Swahili. My goal is to ensure that African language speakers have access to the same quality of language technology as speakers of high-resource languages.

## Technical Expertise

- **Natural Language Processing**: Machine translation, sentiment analysis, language modeling
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning, transfer learning, transformer models
- **Software Development**: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, web applications
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Google Cloud Platform, Azure, deployment automation

## Research Interests

- Low-resource language NLP
- African language technology
- Computational linguistics
- Neural machine translation
- Voice synthesis for tonal languages
- Cultural AI and ethics

## Education & Background

I have a strong foundation in computer science and linguistics, with specialized training in computational methods for language analysis. My work is informed by both technical expertise and deep cultural knowledge of African languages and traditions.

## Impact

My projects have:
- Served over 50,000 translations for African language pairs
- Created educational resources accessed by learners worldwide
- Built the largest open-source parallel corpus for West African languages
- Developed voice synthesis systems with native African language accents

## Connect With Me

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects that advance African language technology and make NLP tools more accessible to underserved language communities.
