# Pass model assets

This folder is used as the pass "model" (template) for `passkit-generator`.

You should add icon images here:

- `icon.png` (required)
- `icon@2x.png` (recommended)
- `logo.png` (optional)
- `logo@2x.png` (optional)

Apple Wallet expects PNG files.

If you don’t have icons yet, you can create simple ones from your existing `static/images/logo.svg` by exporting to PNG.
